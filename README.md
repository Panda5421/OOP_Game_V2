Browser based word-guessing game: 'Phrase Hunter'.
Uses JavaScript and OOP to select a random, hidden phrase that the player has to guess by clicking/typing letters on a keyboard.

I adjusted the background color for the overlay's win/lose classes, as well as for the chosen letter's wrong class. 

I, also, added sound effects to the game. To do this, I created a helper method to create the audio and source elements to hold the sounds and add them to the DOM. Thus, a corresponding sound is now played whenever a user types/clicks a correct/wrong letter, and when the game is won/lost.
